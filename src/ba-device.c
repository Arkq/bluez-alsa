	 * has to comply to the license warranty, which states that anything
	 * can happen. In our case it is true to the letter - SIGSEGV is 100%
	 * guaranteed.
	 *
	 * Our transport structure holds reference to some other transport
	 * structure within the same hash-table. Unfortunately, such a usage
	 * is not supported. Almost every GLib-2.0 function facilitates cache,
	 * which backfires at us if we modify hash-table from the inside of
	 * the destroy function. However, it is possible to "iterate" over
	 * a hash-table in a pop-like matter - reinitialize iterator after
	 * every modification. And voila - modification-safe remove loop. */
